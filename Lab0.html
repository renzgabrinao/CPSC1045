        <p>
            Dogs are better as pets than cats. Dogs are very obedient if trained properly while cats
            are sometimes reserved or selfish. Dogs will cheer you up in the morning while cats will
            just beg for their breakfast to be served.Blah blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah.
            That is why dogs are better.
